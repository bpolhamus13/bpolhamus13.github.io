  <h1>RoadMap for Development</h1>

  <p> Hello there! My name is Brian Polhamus. I currently attend the University of Cincinnati in my last semester. I am making this website/blog because well I am a perfectionist. This semester has just begun and my classes are pretty easy, especially for my final semester. I needed a form to push myself. I thought why not revisit everything I have ever been taught for programming and get a refresher.</p>
  <p> I am a moderate programmer. I have taken many classes and have interned for 2 years for a Fortune 500 company doing mostly Java development but have worked on a variety of projects. I have an eye for design and have also taken courses in design as well as having experience (sort of) as a Graphic Designer.</p>
  <p> But now I am entering the real world. And it scares me. I do not know if I know enough (confusing right?). So I am making this roadMap of online courses and tasks I <b>should</b> complete.</p>
  <p>Now even though I have an easy semester I do not have a lot of free time. I am very involved on campus. Also looking at the list I am creating, man, I have my work cut out. I will <b>most likely</b> not finish this semester. Or Ever. I do however have a better chance at completing this now that I have created this website(which in itself is a review). I am not sure I will even make this public. I am going to comment on each course and try to publish my notes.</p>
